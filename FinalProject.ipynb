    "There are about 1.2 million asteroid data in the NASA JPL Small-Body Database, however not every data has complete parameters, in this project we will have two topics:\n","\n",
    "1) Asteroid Mining: We will use several orbital parameters, probably including asteroid size, mass (if available) and bulk albedo to predict possible spectral classifications. It is actually a classification challenge, we expect to use at least two different methods here, such as K-Means and PCA.\n",

    "\n",
    "2) It is easy to find the lack of GM in many data points, so it could be useful if we could predict the possible mass from the known parameters. In this part, we will build a neural network to give the possible mass range of asteroids with unknown mass. [Reference](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1203.4336.pdf)\n",
