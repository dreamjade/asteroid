    "The idea comes from [Science Projects: Asteroid Mining](https://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/project-ideas/Astro_p038/astronomy/asteroid-mining-gold-rush-in-space).\n",

    "4) Asteroid Mass Estimator (backup topic):\n",
    "\n",
    "There has been little quantitative analysis of asteroid masses in the NASA JPL dataset,  the majority of the data points lack GM values. That is because an accurate asteroid masses estimation usually requires close encounters or high-accuracy orbit observation of a multiple-body system. However, mass is one of the most crucial asteroid features. One may determine the potential interior composition of an asteroid by combining its mass and size. The makeup of asteroids is a reflection of the accretion and collisional environment that existed in the early solar system. Therefore, it could be useful if we could predict the possible mass from the known parameters. In this part, we will build a neural network to give the possible mass range of asteroids with unknown mass. Similar concepts have been discussed in [Agnan 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273117721004622). \n",
    "\n",
    "However, considering that quality is affected by multiple observables, only 15 GM data points are likely to be insufficient for even the most preliminary analysis. As a result, we need to gather information from papers about asteroid masses. mass estimates could be done according to orbital deflections during close encounters ([Michalak 2000](https://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/pdf/2000A%26A...360..363M), [2001](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2001/29/aa10228.pdf); [Zielenbach 2011](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-6256/142/4/120/pdf)), planetary ephemerides ([Baer & Chesley 2008](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10569-007-9103-8.pdf); [Baer et al. 2011](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-6256/141/5/143/pdf); [Fienga et al. 2008](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2008/49/aa6607-06.pdf), [2009](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2009/45/aa11755-09.pdf), [2014](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.0484.pdf)), and a comprehensive review of prior research ([Density of asteroids by B. Carry](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1203.4336.pdf)). There are also some recently results based on the data from ESA Gaia mission ([Siltala & Granvik 2021A](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2022/02/aa41459-21/aa41459-21.html),[2021B](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/abe948)) .\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as the volume is the third power of the dimension, the inferred mass error could result from inaccurate dimensions, which would result in a threefold increase in the error ([Hanuš et al. 2017](https://www.aanda.org/component/article?access=doi&doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201629956#R32)).\n",
